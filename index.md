## Morgan Roggenbaum's Engineering Project Portfolio

On this website, I will be creating an engineering project portfolio to showcase the projects I have completed in my undergraduate and graduate studies. I plan include projects from ENGR 422, BE 468, BE 466 (capstone), and my master's research.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/mroggenbaum/engr-project-portfolio/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
